I'm a creative, software engineer and aspiring game designer coming from an extensive and storied path in the Music Industry as both a performing artist and a music publisher. 

Through sync licensing, I helped to soundtrack some of the highest profile video game franchises, with titles including (but not limited to): _Grand Theft Auto_, _FIFA_, _Madden_ & countless others -- my favorite being the trailer for **_Fallout 3_** which used the song "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" by the Ink Spots.

Within my first week of studying web development I'd already built _over_ **5 browser-based games** using just HTML, CSS & Javascript. I'm currently enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering 2.0 Immersive and have quickly found refuge in the endless possibilities of creative programming and composing new code constantly.

Feel free to enjoy the code I've already posted of some templates for [Air Hockey](https://boomtown.surge.sh), Connect Four, Tic Tac Toe, Pong and more.
