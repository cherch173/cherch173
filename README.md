I'm a **software engineer** and **full stack web developer** coming from a background in the Music Industry as both a performing artist and a music publisher. 

I helped to soundtrack titles and trailers for several major video game franchises such as _Grand Theft Auto_, _Fallout_, the _EA Sports_ catalog (_FIFA_, _Madden_), _NBA 2k_, _Guitar Hero_ and more. 

I've developed and deployed several full stack web applications using a diverse array of tech stacks (my favorite being **React.js** at the moment), methodologies, languages and frameworks including those showcased here, as well as countless others.
