### I'm **Brian**.

I'm a creative and **software engineer** with a passion for **web application and game design** coming from a background in the Music Industry as both a performing artist and a music publisher. 

Through sync licensing, I helped to soundtrack some of the highest profile video game franchises, with titles including (but not limited to): _Grand Theft Auto_, _FIFA_, _Madden_ & countless others -- my favorite being the trailer for **_Fallout 3_** which used the song "I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire" by _the Ink Spots_.

Within my first week of studying Software Engineering I'd already built _over_ **5 browser-based games** using just HTML, CSS & Javascript. I'm currently enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering 2.0 Immersive and have quickly found refuge in the endless possibilities of creative programming and find myself composing new code constantly.
